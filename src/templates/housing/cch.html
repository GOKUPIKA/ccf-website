        <h3>Campus Approved Housing</h3>

        <p>Our men's residential facility was completed in the fall of 2000 with an addition which was completed just
           in time for the spring of 2015. The house provides housing for 64 male students. We are approved by S&amp;T
           as student housing which allows us to house all students - from brand new freshmen to grad students</p>

        <h3>Low cost, High fellowship</h3>

        <p>The CCH is much cheaper then the on-campus residence halls, at just $1600/$1900 per semester (depending on
            which room you live in). But cost is not the only draw to the CCH. With a good mix of older and incoming
            students, the fellowship experience is invaluable in our christian walk.</p>

        <p>The CCH is central to the entire CCF community. With over 200 students, this provides an excellent
            opportunity to fellowship with many other Christians.</p>

        <h3>The House</h3>

        <p>The CCH has 16 spacious bedroom/suites holding 4 residents each. Each resident gets his own wardrobe/closet,
            bed and desk. While the bedrooms are restricted to men only, the house also provides a kitchen, lounge,
            game room, TV/Music room, and other areas that are open to everyone until 1am. Occasionally, the
            residential areas are opened up for anyone to visit during the day. This is a great time for each room
            to show off their unique configuration and decorations.</p>

        <h3>Convenient Location</h3>

        <p>The CCH is located just one block east of campus, two blocks south of the WCCH, and within walking distance
            of downtown Rolla, a couple city parks, and several restaurants.</p>

        <h3>Automobiles</h3>

        <p>The CCH allows all residents to bring a car. The CCH has some parking behind the house and a secondary lot
            just half a block away as well as parking available on the streets surrounding the house. All parking is
            on a first come-first served basis, but there is generally plenty of space to park your car. </p>

        <p>If you don't have a car, don't worry. There are plenty of guys that do and are willing to give you a ride to
            Walmart or church.</p>

        <h3>Student Meal Plans</h3>

        <p>All residents are required to be on our CCH in-house meal plan. According to campus rules, students with
            under 60 credits are required to be on a full meal plan while those who have completed over 60 credits can
            take out the minimum of our evening meal plan. See the
            <a target="_blank" href="/files/Christian_Campus_House_Meal_Contract_2015.pdf">meal plan price sheet</a>
            for more information.
        </p>

        <p>We do have some fridge and freezer space as well as cabinet storage in our basement kitchen area for residents to store and prepare food.</p>

        <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>

        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">There are only a few things that are considered mandatory as a CCH resident, you are a representative of this ministry and of Jesus Christ to others within the
            campus community. Residents are expected to be 'above reproach'
            ({{ verseLink('1Ti3.2', '1st Timothy 3:2') }}). You are to live a life of integrity and have the highest of
            moral standards. All residents are expected to:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top:0;">
            <li>Attend weekly church services at the local church of their choice</li>
            <li>Participate in a weekly CCF <a href="/catalyst/small_groups">Small Group</a> Bible study</li>
            <li>Attend and participate in the weekly CCF meeting, <a href="/catalyst/semester_series">Catalyst</a></li>
            <li>Complete weekly house chores in a timely and thorough manner</li>
            <li>Attendance at one house retreat each semester and monthly house meetings
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lightsaber Policies</h3>

        <p>While it is unlikely that you will aquire the necessary parts in this region of space, anything is available
            through Amazon.com. Should you find yourself feeling fearful or angry (those are the paths to the dark
            side...), we ask that you NOT move forward with plans to construct the most elegant weapon for the civilized
            age in which we live. All other lightsaber building inquiries will be handled by the ministry staff on a
            case by case basis.</p>
