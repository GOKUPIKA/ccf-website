        <li>
            <b>The purpose of the Christian Campus House/Fellowship:</b> The ultimate purpose of the Christian Campus
            Fellowship is to glorify God and proclaim the gospel. One way CCF accomplishes this is by providing a
            Christian atmosphere in which students can live, study, and grow spiritually while attending Missouri S&amp;T.
            Any student who professes a belief in the one Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, or expresses an interest in
            accepting Him as their personal Savior, will be considered for residence in the Christian Campus House.
        </li>
        <li><b>Application and Rent Procedures and Information:</b>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Application to the Christian Campus House may be made in person or
                    <a href="/housing/application">online</a>. All applicants must be a current Missouri S&amp;T
                    student by the move in date.
                </li>
                <li>Once the application has been received and processed, every effort should be made by the applicant
                    to visit the campus house and to participate in an informal personal interview with the campus
                    minister(s).
                </li>
                <li>Applicants will be notified on or around May 1st or December 1st prior to the semester for which
                    they are seeking housing, as to whether or not they have been selected to live in the Christian
                    Campus House.
                </li>
                <li>Upon selection, the applicant will receive a housing contract in the mail which should be filled out
                    and returned along with a $300 deposit. The deposit will be returned upon vacating the house
                    provided the room passes check-out inspections and procedures, no damage has been sustained due to
                    actions during residency, no fines or payments are outstanding, and keys are returned.
                </li>
                <li>Rent payment options, due dates, late charges, and penalties for non-payment are outlined in the
                    Christian Campus House housing contract. Rent charged to Men's House residents includes housing,
                    utilities, use of kitchen and all other house facilities. Rent charged to residents of the attached
                    apartments includes housing and water. Electricity is the responsibility of the apartment
                    resident(s). The Women's House residents are responsible for all utilities.
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Men's Campus House: <strong>Regular Rooms: </strong><u>$1,600 per semester per person</u>, <strong>Suites: </strong><u>$1,900 per semester per person</u></li>
                        <li>Women's Campus House: <u>$1,300 per semester per person</u></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The duration of the housing contract is a school year. Residents who wish to return the following year will be evaluated
                    on whether or not they have met the housing requirements and their involvement in the house fellowship activities.
                    This may result in a meeting with a campus minister and possibly a probationary period.
                    Residents that move out before the conclusion of a
                    contract period will forfeit their deposit. Exceptions are made for students informing the office at
                    least one month prior to start of a MST approved cooperative and other work/study assignments.
                    Additional rent and contract will be necessary for students desiring to live in the campus house
                    between the end of the spring semester and beginning of fall semester.
                </li>
                <li>Summer residency is available at reduced rates. Information on summer rates is available by
                    contacting <a href="mailto:andy@rollaccf.org">Andy Conklin</a>.
                </li>
                <li>After a housing contract has been signed, any resident wishing to break the contract may be charged
                    a contract breaking fee as follows:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>If the contract is broken within 30 days after signing, they may forfeit the deposit of
                            $300.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the contract is broken more than 30 days after signing, they may forfeit their deposit
                            and pay an additional one month's rent (equivalent to Â¼ total semester rent).
                        </li>
